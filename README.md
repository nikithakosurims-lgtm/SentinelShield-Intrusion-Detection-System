# SentinelShield: Advanced Intrusion Detection & Web Protection System

## Project Overview
SentinelShield is a simulated intrusion detection and web protection system designed to demonstrate how web application firewalls (WAFs) and security monitoring tools detect malicious requests and abnormal traffic behavior. This project focuses on request inspection, attack signature detection, rate limiting, logging, and security analysis.

## Objectives
- Analyze HTTP requests from a security perspective  
- Detect common web attacks such as SQL Injection and XSS  
- Simulate brute-force behavior using rate limiting concepts  
- Generate and analyze security logs  
- Understand real-world intrusion detection workflows  

## Tools Used
- curl  
- Browser Developer Tools  
- Windows Command Prompt  
- Manual log analysis  

## Project Structure
- Documentation/ – Practical journal and final report  
- Screenshots/ – Evidence of testing and execution  
- Logs/ – Generated security logs  
- Test_Requests/ – Documented attack payloads and test cases  

## Key Security Concepts Demonstrated
- Rule-based attack detection  
- HTTP request inspection  
- Signature-based detection  
- Rate limiting and behavior monitoring  
- Log analysis and incident interpretation
